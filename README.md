# adschedules-defunct
(DEFUNCT AS OF NOV 2022) Google Ads Script that automatically removes overspending Ad Schedules and handles bid adjustments. 

# How it Works 
This script compares each campaign's cost-per-conversion in an account to the cost-per-conversion(if there are any conversions)/cost(if there are no conversions) of every ad schedule. If the ad schedule's cost-per-conversion/cost is 50% more than the campaign's cost-per-conversion, the ad schedule is either removed or its bid is adjusted.
